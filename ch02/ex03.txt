When there aren't enough elements, it raises an Exception, which seems to be idiomatic, because that's what calling head on a empty list does:

Prelude> :load "ex02.hs"
[1 of 1] Compiling Main             ( ex02.hs, interpreted )
Ok, modules loaded: Main.
*Main> lastButOne [1, 2, 3, 4]
3
*Main> lastButOne [1, 2, 3]
2
*Main> lastButOne [1, 2]
1
*Main> lastButOne [1]
*** Exception: Prelude.last: empty list
*Main> lastButOne []
*** Exception: Prelude.last: empty list
